In this thesis we study the properties of quantum walks with time dependent hamiltonian, focusing in particular on the application to the quantum search problem on graph. We compare the time independent and the time dependent approach for two graph topologies, the circular and the complete graph, which represent respectively the worst and best case scenario for the known quantum search. We also investigate the role of the function that regulates the time-dependance of the hamiltonian in the time scaling at which the solution is found. Lastly we exploit the consequences of the adiabatic theorem to study the localization properties of the time-dependent approach.
