In this thesis we study the application of quantum walks with time-dependent Hamiltonian to the search problem on graph.\\ \\

\noindent
Our work can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In Chapter 1  we recall the minimum theoretical knowledge necessary to follow the work done in this thesis. We introduce some basic notion of graph theory and quantum walks and the main characteristic of the graph considered. We then introduce the quantum search problem as firstly posed by Grover, followed by its quantum walks implementation. Then we discuss the adiabatic theorem and its application to the search problem, focusing in particular on the difference between global and local adiabatic evolution. Lastly we show that an adiabatic-quantum walks search algorithm is not possible

  \item In Chapter 2 we study quantum walks with time-dependent Hamiltonians, focusing on the application to the search problem. In particular we study the cycle graph and the complete graph. The goal of this section is to determine if a time-dependent Hamiltonian, inspired by the adiabatic implementation can bring any advantages to the search problem on graph.


\end{itemize}
Finally, conclusions and future perspective complete this thesis.
