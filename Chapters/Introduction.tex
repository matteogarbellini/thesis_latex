In this thesis we study the application of quantum walks with time-dependent hamiltonian to the search problem on graph.


Our work can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item In Chapter 1  we recall the minimum theoretical knowledge necessary to follow this thesis. We introduce some basic notion of graph theory and quantum walks and the main characteristic of the graph considered. We then introduce the quantum search problem as firstly posed by Grover, followed by its quantum walks implementation of Childs and Goldstone. Then we discuss the adiabatic theorem and its application to the search problem, in particular  
\item In Chapter 2
\end{itemize}
